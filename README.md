## UFC Fight Predictor

Tiger Millionaire (T-M) is a project whose goal is to use machine learning models to predict the winner of Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) fights. Not only will it predict winners, it will use the odds to predict profitable bets. The project will be deemed to be a success if we can create a model that is able to return a profit.

### Initial Steps

* The original data set comes from [Rajeev Warrier's Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rajeevw/ufcdata/)
* I have modified to data to add extra features and remove some rows
* The models predict who will win the 'Blue' fighter or the 'Red' fighter.  The red fighter is generally the favorite.
